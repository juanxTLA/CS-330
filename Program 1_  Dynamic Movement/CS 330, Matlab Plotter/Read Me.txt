The folder CS 330, Matlab Plotter contains 2 scripts
	-cs330_simple_plot.m
	-cs330_plot_caller.m

cs330_simple_plot.m
	This is the function that plots a png and/or gif
	Move this file to the same folder as your trajectories files.
	The output of this function will be contained in a folder
	titled 'simple_plot_output'.
	
	Use 'help cs330_simple_plot' in the matlab terminal to read
	the documentation for the function

	Note* This function can take ~225+ seconds of time to run
	if you're plotting at least 2 characters with a 0.25 second
	time step

cs330_plot_caller.m
	This is an example matlab script showing how to call the function.
	Move this file to the same folder as the plot function and the 
	trajectories files.
	
	Simply edit the predeclared variables to your likeling and run.

Below is the output when you run 'help cs330_simple_plot'

    cs330_simple_plot(trajectoryFile, PVLO, gif, plotTitle, vectorScaling) 
                     Creates a plot and gif given trajectory info. 
                     Output will be written in a folder 'simple_plot_output'
 
    trajectoryFile = A .txt or .csv file containing trajectory information
                     in the comma seperated form delimited by a new line,
                     'time, characterNumber, position[1], position[2], 
                     velocity[1], velocity[2], linear[1], linear[2], 
                     orientation, rotation, angular\n'
 
    PVLO           = An array of 4 bools indicating what should be plotted. 
 
                     Passing a four element array can be used to plot some
                     values, but not others. The bools correspond in the
                     order [position, velocity, linear, orientation].
 
                     For example,
                     If an array is passed like [1,1,1,0]; 
                     position, velocity, and linear acceleration will be 
                     plotted, but orientation will NOT be plotted.
 
    gif            = Either a logical 1 or a logical 0. 
                     If 1 a gif of the plots will be automatically generated.
                     If 0 a gif will NOT be generated.
 
    plotTitle      = A string containing the name of physics used.
                     This string will be used in the plot title.
 
    vectorScaling  = A value used to lengthen or shorten all vectors
                     lengths. 
                     Ex. 4 or 6 are good defaults.
